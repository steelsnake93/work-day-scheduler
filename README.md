## User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Features

- Displays the current day at the top of the calendar when the user opens the app
- Presents time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm)
- Color-codes each time block based on past, present, or future
- Allows a user to enter an event when they click a time block
- Saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block
- Persists events between refreshes of the page

## Getting Started

To use the app, simply open the deployed page in your web browser. You can enter events by clicking on the time blocks and typing in the text area that appears. Click the "Save" button to save your event, which will persist even if you refresh the page.
